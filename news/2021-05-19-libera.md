# Moving to Libera.Chat

On May 19, Freenode staff lost their control of the network. This has been
developing for a while and staffers set up [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/)
in case it happened. Foss revolves around people volunteering their time, as
did the Freenode network. We have decided to move the #ranger channel because
we believe the volunteer staffers have our best interests at heart.

The king is dead, long live the king!
