# Moving to Libera.Chat

On May 19, [Freenode staff lost their control of the network](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409).
This has been developing for a while and staffers set up
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) in case it happened. Foss revolves around
people volunteering their time, as did the Freenode network. We have decided to
move the #ranger channel because we believe the volunteer staffers have our
best interests at heart.

The king is dead, long live the king!
