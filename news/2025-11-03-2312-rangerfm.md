# New website domain + host

The URL of ranger's website changed from [https://ranger.github.io](https://ranger.github.io) to [https://ranger.fm](https://ranger.fm).  The code of the website is also now hosted on codeberg: [https://codeberg.org/ranger/pages](https://codeberg.org/ranger/pages).

Actually this change has been made a while ago, but it's time to make it official. :)

Reasons were:

- GitHub was acquired by Microsoft
- AI integration, copyright infringement and [embrace-extend-extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish) tactics
- Removes a dependency on an american for-profit megacorporation
- Own URL grants us flexibility to change the host more smoothly
- Codeberg is run by a german non-profit with solid ethics
